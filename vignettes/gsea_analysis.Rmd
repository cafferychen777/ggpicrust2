## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on PICRUSt2 predicted functional data using the ggpicrust2 package. GSEA is a powerful method for interpreting gene expression data by focusing on gene sets (pathways) rather than individual genes. In the context of microbiome functional prediction, GSEA can help identify pathways that are enriched in different conditions.

## Installation

First, make sure you have the necessary packages installed:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
# Install ggpicrust2
if (!requireNamespace("ggpicrust2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  devtools::install_github("cafferychen777/ggpicrust2")
}

# Install required Bioconductor packages
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install(c("limma", "fgsea", "clusterProfiler", "enrichplot", "DOSE", "pathview"))

# Load the package
library(ggpicrust2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Method Selection Guide

The `pathway_gsea()` function supports multiple methods for gene set enrichment analysis:

| Method | Type | Covariate Support | Description |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `camera` (default) | Competitive | ✅ Yes | **Recommended.** Accounts for inter-gene correlations, providing more reliable p-values |
| `fry` | Self-contained | ✅ Yes | Fast rotation test, efficient for large gene set collections |
| `fgsea` | Preranked | ❌ No | Fast preranked GSEA, but p-values may be unreliable |
| `clusterProfiler` | Preranked | ❌ No | Traditional GSEA implementation |

**Why use camera/fry?** Wu et al. (2012) demonstrated that preranked GSEA methods can produce "spectacularly wrong p-values" due to not accounting for inter-gene correlations. The `camera` and `fry` methods from limma address this limitation.

## Basic GSEA Analysis (Recommended: camera method)

Let's start with a basic GSEA analysis using the recommended `camera` method:

```{r basic-gsea, eval=FALSE}
# Load example data
data(ko_abundance)
data(metadata)

# Prepare abundance data
abundance_data <- as.data.frame(ko_abundance)
rownames(abundance_data) <- abundance_data[, "#NAME"]
abundance_data <- abundance_data[, -1]

# Run GSEA analysis with camera (recommended)
gsea_results <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = abundance_data,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  pathway_type = "KEGG",
  method = "camera",
  min_size = 5,
  max_size = 500,
  p.adjust = "BH"
)

# View the top results
head(gsea_results)
```

## Covariate Adjustment

One of the most powerful features of the `camera` and `fry` methods is the ability to adjust for confounding variables. This is particularly important in microbiome studies where factors like age, sex, BMI, and batch effects can influence results.

```{r covariate-gsea, eval=FALSE}
# Example with covariate adjustment
# Assuming metadata has columns: group, age, sex, BMI

gsea_results_adjusted <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = abundance_data,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Disease",
  covariates = c("age", "sex", "BMI"),  # Adjust for these confounders
  pathway_type = "KEGG",
  method = "camera"
)

# The results now reflect the group effect after adjusting for confounders
head(gsea_results_adjusted)
```

## Fast Analysis with fry

For large datasets or when computational efficiency is important, use the `fry` method:

```{r fry-gsea, eval=FALSE}
# Fast rotation gene set test
gsea_results_fry <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = abundance_data,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  pathway_type = "KEGG",
  method = "fry",
  min_size = 5,
  max_size = 500
)

head(gsea_results_fry)
```

## Legacy: Preranked GSEA (fgsea)

For compatibility with existing workflows, preranked GSEA methods are still available:

```{r fgsea, eval=FALSE}
# Note: Preranked methods don't account for inter-gene correlations
# P-values may be less reliable (Wu et al., 2012)
gsea_results_fgsea <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = abundance_data,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  pathway_type = "KEGG",
  method = "fgsea",
  rank_method = "signal2noise",
  nperm = 1000,
  min_size = 10,
  max_size = 500,
  p.adjust = "BH",
  seed = 42
)

# View the top results
head(gsea_results_fgsea)
```

## Annotating GSEA Results

To make the results more interpretable, we can annotate them with pathway names and descriptions:

```{r annotate-gsea, eval=FALSE}
# Annotate GSEA results
annotated_results <- gsea_pathway_annotation(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  pathway_type = "KEGG"
)

# View the annotated results
head(annotated_results)
```

## Visualizing GSEA Results

The ggpicrust2 package provides several visualization options for GSEA results. The `visualize_gsea()` function automatically detects whether pathway names are available (from `gsea_pathway_annotation()`) and uses them for better readability, falling back to pathway IDs if names are not available.

### Pathway Label Options

The `visualize_gsea()` function offers flexible pathway labeling:

```{r pathway-labels, eval=FALSE}
# Option 1: Use raw GSEA results (shows pathway IDs)
plot_with_ids <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  plot_type = "barplot",
  n_pathways = 10
)

# Option 2: Use annotated results (automatically shows pathway names)
plot_with_names <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  plot_type = "barplot",
  n_pathways = 10
)

# Option 3: Explicitly specify which column to use for labels
plot_custom_labels <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  plot_type = "barplot",
  pathway_label_column = "pathway_name",
  n_pathways = 10
)

# Compare the plots
plot_with_ids
plot_with_names
plot_custom_labels
```

### Barplot

```{r barplot, eval=FALSE}
# Create a barplot of the top enriched pathways
barplot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  plot_type = "barplot",
  n_pathways = 20,
  sort_by = "p.adjust"
)

# Display the plot
barplot
```

### Dotplot

```{r dotplot, eval=FALSE}
# Create a dotplot of the top enriched pathways
dotplot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  plot_type = "dotplot",
  n_pathways = 20,
  sort_by = "p.adjust"
)

# Display the plot
dotplot
```

### Enrichment Plot

```{r enrichment-plot, eval=FALSE}
# Create an enrichment plot for a specific pathway
enrichment_plot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  plot_type = "enrichment_plot",
  n_pathways = 10,
  sort_by = "NES"
)

# Display the plot
enrichment_plot
```

## Comparing GSEA and DAA Results

It can be informative to compare the results from GSEA with those from Differential Abundance Analysis (DAA):

```{r compare-gsea-daa, eval=FALSE}
# Run DAA analysis
daa_results <- pathway_daa(
  abundance = abundance_data,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  daa_method = "ALDEx2"
)

# Annotate DAA results
annotated_daa_results <- pathway_annotation(
  pathway = "KO",
  daa_results_df = daa_results,
  ko_to_kegg = TRUE
)

# Compare GSEA and DAA results
comparison <- compare_gsea_daa(
  gsea_results = annotated_results,
  daa_results = annotated_daa_results,
  plot_type = "venn",
  p_threshold = 0.05
)

# Display the comparison plot
comparison$plot

# View the comparison results
comparison$results
```

## Integrated Analysis with ggpicrust2_extended

For a more streamlined workflow, you can use the `ggpicrust2_extended` function, which integrates both DAA and GSEA analyses:

```{r integrated-analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Run integrated analysis
integrated_results <- ggpicrust2_extended(
  data = ko_abundance,
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  pathway = "KO",
  daa_method = "LinDA",
  ko_to_kegg = TRUE,
  run_gsea = TRUE,
  gsea_params = list(
    method = "fgsea",
    rank_method = "signal2noise",
    nperm = 1000
  )
)

# Access DAA results
daa_results <- integrated_results$daa_results

# Access GSEA results
gsea_results <- integrated_results$gsea_results

# Access plots
daa_plot <- integrated_results$daa_plot
gsea_plot <- integrated_results$gsea_plot
```

## Conclusion

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis provides a complementary approach to Differential Abundance Analysis for interpreting PICRUSt2 predicted functional data. By focusing on pathways rather than individual features, GSEA can help identify biologically meaningful patterns that might be missed by traditional methods.

### Key Recommendations

1. **Use `camera` method (default)** for most analyses - it provides more reliable p-values by accounting for inter-gene correlations

2. **Adjust for covariates** when you have confounding factors like age, sex, or BMI in your study design

3. **Use `fry` method** when you need faster computation for large gene set collections

4. **Use preranked methods (`fgsea`)** only when you need compatibility with existing workflows, and interpret p-values with caution
