ðŸŒŸ **If you find `ggpicrust2` helpful, please consider giving us a star on GitHub!** Your support greatly motivates us to improve and maintain this project. ðŸŒŸ

*ggpicrust2* is a comprehensive package designed to provide a seamless and intuitive solution for analyzing and interpreting the results of PICRUSt2 functional prediction. It offers a wide range of features, including pathway name/description annotations, advanced differential abundance (DA) methods, and visualization of DA results.

One of the newest additions to *ggpicrust2* is the capability to compare the consistency and inconsistency across different DA methods applied to the same dataset. This feature allows users to assess the agreement and discrepancy between various methods when it comes to predicting and sequencing the metagenome of a particular sample. It provides valuable insights into the consistency of results obtained from different approaches and helps users evaluate the robustness of their findings.

By leveraging this functionality, researchers, data scientists, and bioinformaticians can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes and mechanisms present in their PICRUSt2 output data. This comparison of different methods enables them to make informed decisions and draw reliable conclusions based on the consistency evaluation of macrogenomic predictions or sequencing results for the same sample.

If you are interested in exploring and analyzing your PICRUSt2 output data, *ggpicrust2* is a powerful tool that provides a comprehensive set of features, including the ability to assess the consistency and evaluate the performance of different methods applied to the same dataset.

## News

ðŸ”„ **Updated Reference Databases for Improved Pathway Annotation (v2.1.4)**

We've significantly enhanced the reference databases used for pathway annotation:

- **EC reference data**: Updated from 3,180 to 8,371 entries (163% increase)
- **KO reference data**: Updated from 23,917 to 27,531 unique KO IDs (15.4% increase)

These updates provide more comprehensive and accurate pathway annotations, especially for recently discovered enzymes and KEGG orthology entries. Users will experience improved coverage and precision in pathway analysis without needing to change any code.

ðŸŒŸ **New Feature: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for PICRUSt2 Data**

We're excited to announce the addition of GSEA functionality to the ggpicrust2 package! This powerful new feature allows researchers to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on PICRUSt2 predicted functional profiles, offering a more nuanced understanding of functional differences between conditions.

The new GSEA module includes:

- `pathway_gsea()`: Performs GSEA analysis on PICRUSt2 data
- `visualize_gsea()`: Creates various visualizations including enrichment plots, dot plots, network plots, and heatmaps
- `compare_gsea_daa()`: Compares GSEA and differential abundance analysis results
- `gsea_pathway_annotation()`: Annotates GSEA results with pathway information

These new functions complement our existing differential abundance analysis tools, providing researchers with multiple approaches to analyze functional profiles.

ðŸŒŸ **Also Check Out: `mLLMCelltype`**

We're excited to introduce `mLLMCelltype`, our innovative framework for **single-cell RNA sequencing data annotation**. This iterative multi-LLM consensus framework leverages the collective intelligence of multiple large language models (including GPT-4o/4.1, Claude-3.7/3.5, Gemini-2.0, Grok-3, and others) to significantly improve cell type annotation accuracy while providing transparent uncertainty quantification.

`mLLMCelltype` addresses critical challenges in scRNA-seq analysis through its unique architecture:

- **Multi-LLM Consensus**: Overcomes single-model limitations by harnessing diverse LLMs' collective intelligence
- **Structured Deliberation**: Enables models to share reasoning, evaluate evidence, and refine annotations through collaborative discussion
- **Transparent Uncertainty Metrics**: Provides quantitative measures to identify ambiguous cell populations requiring expert review
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Suppresses inaccurate predictions through cross-model critical evaluation
- **No Reference Dataset Required**: Performs accurate annotation without pre-training or reference data

For researchers working with single-cell data, `mLLMCelltype` offers a powerful new approach to cell type annotation. Learn more about its capabilities and methodology on GitHub: [mLLMCelltype Repository](https://github.com/cafferychen777/mLLMCelltype).

We appreciate your support and interest in our tools and look forward to seeing how they can enhance your research.

## Workflow {#workflow}

The easiest way to analyze the PICRUSt2 output is using ggpicrust2() function. The main pipeline can be run with ggpicrust2() function.

ggpicrust2() integrates ko abundance to kegg pathway abundance conversion, annotation of pathway, differential abundance (DA) analysis, part of DA results visualization. When you have trouble running ggpicrust2(), you can debug it by running a separate function, which will greatly increase the speed of your analysis and visualization.

## function details {#function-details}

### ko2kegg_abundance() {#ko2kegg_abundance}

KEGG Orthology(KO) is a classification system developed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) data-base(Kanehisa et al., 2022). It uses a hierarchical structure to classify enzymes based on the reactions they catalyze. To better understand pathways' role in different groups and classify the pathways, the KO abundance table needs to be converted to KEGG pathway abundance. But PICRUSt2 removes the function from PICRUSt. ko2kegg_abundance() can help convert the table.


``` r
# Sample usage of the ko2kegg_abundance function
devtools::install_github('cafferychen777/ggpicrust2')

library(ggpicrust2)

# Assume that the KO abundance table is stored in a file named "ko_abundance.tsv"
ko_abundance_file <- "ko_abundance.tsv"

# Convert KO abundance to KEGG pathway abundance
kegg_abundance <- ko2kegg_abundance(file = ko_abundance_file)

# Alternatively, if the KO abundance data is already loaded as a data frame named "ko_abundance"
data("ko_abundance")
kegg_abundance <- ko2kegg_abundance(data = ko_abundance)

# The resulting kegg_abundance data frame can now be used for further analysis and visualization.

```

### pathway_daa() {#pathway_daa}

Differential abundance(DA) analysis plays a major role in PICRUSt2 downstream analysis. pathway_daa() integrates almost all DA methods applicable to the predicted functional profile which there excludes ANCOM and ANCOMBC. It includes [ALDEx2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html)(Fernandes et al., 2013), [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)(Love et al., 2014), [Maaslin2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Maaslin2.html)(Mallick et al., 2021), [LinDA](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02655-5)(Zhou et al., 2022), [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)(Robinson et al., 2010) , [limma voom](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2018-June-RNA-Seq-Workshop/thursday/DE.html)(Ritchie et al., 2015), [metagenomeSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metagenomeSeq.html#:~:text=metagenomeSeq%20is%20designed%20to%20address,the%20testing%20of%20feature%20correlations.)(Paulson et al., 2013), [Lefser](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/lefser.html)(Segata et al., 2011).


``` r
# The abundance table is recommended to be a data.frame rather than a tibble.

```

### pathway_annotation() {#pathway_annotation}

**If you are in China and you are using kegg pathway annotation, Please make sure your internet can break through the firewall.**

**New Feature (v2.1.4)**: The `pathway_annotation()` function now supports species-specific KEGG pathway annotation through the new `organism` parameter. You can specify KEGG organism codes (e.g., "hsa" for human, "eco" for E. coli) to get species-specific pathway information. If no organism is specified (default), the function retrieves generic KO information not specific to any organism.


``` r

# Make sure to check if the features in `daa_results_df` correspond to the selected pathway

# Annotate KEGG Pathway
data("kegg_abundance")
data("metadata")
# Please change group to "your_group_column" if you are not using example dataset
daa_results_df <- pathway_daa(abundance = kegg_abundance, metadata = metadata, group = "Environment", daa_method = "LinDA")

# Generic KO to KEGG pathway annotation (not specific to any organism)
daa_annotated_results_df <- pathway_annotation(pathway = "KO", daa_results_df = daa_results_df, ko_to_kegg = TRUE)

ecoli_annotated_results_df <- pathway_annotation(pathway = "KO", daa_results_df = daa_results_df, ko_to_kegg = TRUE, organism = "eco")

# Annotate KO
data("ko_abundance")
data("metadata")
# Please change column_to_rownames() to the feature column if you are not using example dataset

# Annotate KEGG
# daa_annotated_results_df <- pathway_annotation(pathway = "EC", daa_results_df = daa_results_df, ko_to_kegg = FALSE)

# Annotate MetaCyc Pathway
data("metacyc_abundance")
data("metadata")
# Please change column_to_rownames() to the feature column if you are not using example dataset
# Please change group to "your_group_column" if you are not using example dataset
metacyc_daa_results_df <- pathway_daa(abundance = metacyc_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("pathway"), metadata = metadata, group = "Environment", daa_method = "LinDA")
metacyc_daa_annotated_results_df <- pathway_annotation(pathway = "MetaCyc", daa_results_df = metacyc_daa_results_df, ko_to_kegg = FALSE)
```

### pathway_errorbar() {#pathway_errorbar}

           x_lab = "description")
```

### pathway_heatmap() {#pathway_heatmap}

In this section, we will demonstrate how to create a pathway heatmap using the `pathway_heatmap` function in the ggpicrust2 package. This function visualizes the relative abundance of pathways in different samples.

abundance_example <- matrix(rnorm(30), nrow = 3, ncol = 10)
colnames(abundance_example) <- paste0("Sample", 1:10)
rownames(abundance_example) <- c("PathwayA", "PathwayB", "PathwayC")

# Create example metadata
# Please change your sample id's column name to sample_name
metadata_example <- data.frame(sample_name = colnames(abundance_example),
                               group = factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each = 5)))

# Create a heatmap
pathway_heatmap(abundance_example, metadata_example, "group")
```

Use the real dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggh4x)

data("metadata")

# Perform differential abundance analysis
metacyc_daa_results_df <- pathway_daa(
  abundance = metacyc_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("pathway"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  daa_method = "LinDA"
)

# Annotate the results
annotated_metacyc_daa_results_df <- pathway_annotation(
  pathway = "MetaCyc",
  daa_results_df = metacyc_daa_results_df,
  ko_to_kegg = FALSE
)

# Filter features with p < 0.05
feature_with_p_0.05 <- metacyc_daa_results_df %>%
  filter(p_adjust < 0.05)

# Create the heatmap
pathway_heatmap(
  abundance = metacyc_abundance %>%
    right_join(
      annotated_metacyc_daa_results_df %>% select(all_of(c("feature","description"))),
      by = c("pathway" = "feature")
    ) %>%
    filter(pathway %in% feature_with_p_0.05$feature) %>%
    select(-"pathway") %>%
    column_to_rownames("description"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment"
)
```
### pathway_pca() {#pathway_pca}

In this section, we will demonstrate how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on functional pathway abundance data and create visualizations of the PCA results using the `pathway_pca` function in the ggpicrust2 package.

Use the fake dataset


``` r
# Create example functional pathway abundance data
abundance_example <- matrix(rnorm(30), nrow = 3, ncol = 10)

                                group = factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each = 5)))
# Perform PCA and create visualizations
pathway_pca(abundance = abundance_example, metadata = metadata_example, "group")
```

Use the real dataset

``` r

# Print the correlation matrix
print(results$correlation$cor_matrix)
# Print the p-value matrix
print(results$correlation$p_matrix)
```

### pathway_gsea() {#pathway_gsea}

The `pathway_gsea()` function performs Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on PICRUSt2 predicted functional profiles. GSEA is a powerful method for identifying enriched pathways between different conditions, offering a more nuanced understanding of functional differences compared to traditional differential abundance analysis.


``` r
library(ggpicrust2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load example data
data("ko_abundance")
data("metadata")

# Perform GSEA analysis
gsea_results <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  method = "fgsea",    # Can be "fgsea" or "GSEA"
  rank_method = "log2_ratio",  # Method to calculate ranking metric
  organism = "ko",    # KEGG organism code
  minSize = 10,       # Minimum gene set size
  maxSize = 500,      # Maximum gene set size
  nperm = 1000        # Number of permutations
)

# View the results
head(gsea_results)
```

### visualize_gsea() {#visualize_gsea}

The `visualize_gsea()` function creates various visualizations for GSEA results, including enrichment plots, dot plots, network plots, and heatmaps.

library(ggpicrust2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load example data and perform GSEA
data("ko_abundance")
data("metadata")

gsea_results <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment"
)

# Create an enrichment plot for a specific pathway
enrichment_plot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  plot_type = "enrichment",
  pathway_id = gsea_results$pathway_id[1]  # Select the first pathway
)

# Create a dot plot showing top enriched pathways
dot_plot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  plot_type = "dot",
  n_pathways = 20,  # Show top 20 pathways
  sort_by = "NES"   # Sort by Normalized Enrichment Score
)

# Create a network plot showing pathway relationships
network_plot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  plot_type = "network",
  n_pathways = 15,
  network_params = list(
    similarity_measure = "jaccard",
    similarity_cutoff = 0.2,
    layout = "fruchterman",
    node_color_by = "NES"
  )
)

# Create a heatmap showing pathway gene expression
heatmap_plot <- visualize_gsea(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  plot_type = "heatmap",
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  n_pathways = 10,
  heatmap_params = list(
    cluster_rows = TRUE,
    cluster_columns = TRUE,
    show_column_names = TRUE,
    show_row_names = FALSE
  )
)
```

### compare_gsea_daa() {#compare_gsea_daa}

The `compare_gsea_daa()` function compares results from GSEA and differential abundance analysis (DAA) to identify pathways that are consistently identified by both methods or uniquely identified by each method.


``` r
library(ggpicrust2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load example data
data("ko_abundance")
data("metadata")

# Perform GSEA analysis
gsea_results <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment"
)

# Perform DAA analysis
daa_results <- pathway_daa(
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment",
  daa_method = "ALDEx2"
)

# Compare GSEA and DAA results
comparison <- compare_gsea_daa(
  gsea_results = gsea_results,
  daa_results_df = daa_results,
  gsea_pvalue_cutoff = 0.05,
  daa_pvalue_cutoff = 0.05,
  plot_type = "venn"  # Can be "venn", "upset", or "both"
)

# View the comparison plot
comparison$plot

# View the overlapping pathways
head(comparison$overlap)
```

### gsea_pathway_annotation() {#gsea_pathway_annotation}

The `gsea_pathway_annotation()` function annotates GSEA results with pathway information, including pathway names, descriptions, and classifications.


``` r
library(ggpicrust2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load example data and perform GSEA
data("ko_abundance")
data("metadata")

gsea_results <- pathway_gsea(
  abundance = ko_abundance %>% column_to_rownames("#NAME"),
  metadata = metadata,
  group = "Environment"
)

# Annotate GSEA results

**Solution 2: Limit to the Top 20 features**

If there are too many significant features to visualize effectively, you might consider limiting your visualization to the top 20 features with the smallest adjusted p-values:

```
daa_results_df_annotated <- daa_results_df_annotated[!is.na(daa_results_df_annotated$pathway_name),]

daa_results_df_annotated$p_adjust <- round(daa_results_df_annotated$p_adjust,5)

low_p_feature <- daa_results_df_annotated[order(daa_results_df_annotated$p_adjust), ]$feature[1:20]


p <- ggpicrust2::pathway_errorbar(
  abundance = kegg_abundance,
  daa_results_df = daa_results_df_annotated,
  Group = metadata$Day,
  p_values_threshold = 0.05,
  order = "pathway_class",
  select = low_p_feature,
  ko_to_kegg = TRUE,
  p_value_bar = FALSE,
  colors = NULL,
  x_lab = "pathway_name")
```

### Issue 7: There are no statistically significant biomarkers

If you are not finding any statistically significant biomarkers in your analysis, there could be several reasons for this:

1.  **The true difference between your groups is small or non-existent.** If the microbial communities or pathways you're comparing are truly similar, then it's correct and expected that you won't find significant differences.

2.  **Your sample size might be too small to detect the differences.** Statistical power, the ability to detect differences if they exist, increases with sample size.

3.  **The variation within your groups might be too large.** If there's a lot of variation in microbial communities within a single group, it can be hard to detect differences between groups.

Here are a few suggestions:

1.  **Increase your sample size**: If possible, adding more samples to your analysis can increase your statistical power, making it easier to detect significant differences.

2.  **Decrease intra-group variation**: If there's a lot of variation within your groups, consider whether there are outliers or subgroups that are driving this variation. You might need to clean your data, or to stratify your analysis to account for these subgroups.

3.  **Change your statistical method or adjust parameters**: Depending on the nature of your data and your specific question, different statistical methods might be more or less powerful. If you're currently using a parametric test, consider using a non-parametric test, or vice versa. Also, consider whether adjusting the parameters of your current test might help.

Remember, not finding significant results is also a result and can be informative, as it might indicate that there are no substantial differences between the groups you're studying. It's important to interpret your results in the context of your specific study and not to force statistical significance where there isn't any.

With these strategies, you should be able to create a more readable and informative visualization, even when dealing with a large number of significant features.
