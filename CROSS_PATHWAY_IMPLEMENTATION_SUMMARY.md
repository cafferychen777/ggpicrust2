### 🔬 Key Technical Innovations

#### 1. Pathway-Agnostic Test Data Generation
```r
create_cross_pathway_test_data <- function(n_samples = 24, effect_size = 1.5) {
  # Creates KO abundance (KEGG/GO) and EC abundance (MetaCyc) data
  # With realistic biological properties and group effects
}
```

#### 2. Mock Gene Set Generation
```r
create_mock_gene_sets <- function(pathway_type, gene_names) {
  # Generates pathway-appropriate mock gene sets
  # KEGG: ko##### format
  # MetaCyc: PWY-#### format  
  # GO: GO:####### format
}
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Result Structure Validation
```r
# Ensures all pathway types return identical column structures
expected_columns <- c(
  "pathway_id", "pathway_name", "size", "ES", "NES", 
  "pvalue", "p.adjust", "leading_edge", "method"
)
```

#### 4. Statistical Property Comparison
```r
# Validates statistical distributions across pathway types
analyze_statistical_properties <- function(results) {
  # Compares NES distributions, p-value ranges, significance rates
}
```
