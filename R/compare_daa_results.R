#' Compare the Consistency of Statistically Significant Features
#'
#' This function compares the consistency and inconsistency of statistically significant features obtained
#' using different methods in `pathway_daa` from the `ggpicrust2` package. It creates a report showing the number of common and
#' different features identified by each method, and the features themselves.
#' @name compare_daa_results
#' @param daa_results_list A list of data frames containing statistically significant features obtained using different methods.
#' @param method_names A character vector of names for each method used.
#' @param p_values_threshold A numeric value representing the threshold for the p-values. Features with p-values less than this
#' threshold are considered statistically significant. Default is 0.05.
#'
#' @return A data frame with the comparison results. The data frame has the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{method}: The name of the method.
#'   \item \code{num_features}: The total number of statistically significant features obtained by the method.
#'   \item \code{num_common_features}: The number of features that are common to other methods.
#'   \item \code{num_diff_features}: The number of features that are different from other methods.
#'   \item \code{common_features}: The names of the features that are common to all methods.
#'   \item \code{diff_features}: The names of the features that are different from other methods.
